1. API (Application Programming Interface)
Definition: A set of rules that allow software components to interact with each other.

Types of APIs:
Open APIs: Publicly available, e.g., Google Maps API.
Internal APIs: Used within an organization.
Partner APIs: Shared with specific business partners.
Composite APIs: Combine multiple API calls into one.
Example:

A payment gateway (e.g., Stripe API) integrates with e-commerce sites.

2. SDK (Software Development Kit)
Definition: A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation to build software for a specific platform or use case.

Components of SDK:
Libraries: Pre-written code for common tasks.
Tools: Debuggers, compilers, etc.
Documentation: Guides and usage examples.
Sample Code: Ready-to-use examples.
Example:

Android SDK for building mobile apps.


3. Web APIs
Definition: APIs designed to be accessed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

Types of Web APIs:
RESTful APIs: Use HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and JSON responses.
SOAP APIs: Use XML and strict standards.
GraphQL APIs: Flexible query-based APIs.
Streaming APIs: Real-time data streams.
Example:

Twitter API allows developers to fetch tweets programmatically.
4. Library APIs
Definition: Functions or methods provided by a library to perform specific tasks.

Types of Libraries:
Standard Libraries: Built into a language (e.g., Python's math).
Third-party Libraries: Developed externally (e.g., NumPy, TensorFlow).
Example:

NumPy library in Python allows operations on arrays.

5. Prompting and Completion
Definition: A method in AI where you provide an input (prompt) to an AI model, and it generates an output (completion).

Types of Prompting:
Few-shot Prompting: Provide a few examples in the prompt.
Zero-shot Prompting: No examples, just instructions.
Chain-of-thought Prompting: Guide the AI step by step.
Completion Types:
Text Completion: Generates text output.
Code Completion: Suggests code snippets.
Content Creation: Creates blogs, articles, etc.
Example:

Prompt: "Write a short story about a robot." Completion: A full story generated by AI.
